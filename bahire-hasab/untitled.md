# Introduction

"Bahire Hasab /'bəhrɛ həsəb'/ " simply means "An age with a descriptive and chronological number". In some books it can also be found as "Hasabe Bahir", in a sense giving time an analogy, resembling a sea.

As the different documents explain, a sea is a never-ending, constant flow of water from its source to limits incomprehensible to the senses of man. As is time.

There are 8 Rules or you can call them conventions too. These are:

1. When calculating `wenber` which is remainder of `ameteAlem` by 19, subtract 1 \(ONE\) from the remainder as of the story in ancient calculation "አንዱን ለዘመኑ ሰጠው".
2. If `metkih` &gt; 14, then month of `metkih` will be at the FIRST month of the year. which is መስከረም.
3. If `metkih` &lt;= 14, then month of `metkih` will be at the SECOND month of the year. which is ጥቅምት.
4. If month of `metkih` is መስከረም \(the FIRST month\), then Nineveh or `nenewe` will be in ጥር \(the FIFTH month\).
5. If month of `metkih` is ጥቅምት \(the FIRST month\), then Nineveh or `nenewe` will be in የካቲት \(the SIXTH month\).
6. If the summation of `metkih` and the corresponding number of the weekday that `metkih` is on, is greater than 30 \(&gt; 30\) then Nineveh or `nenewe` will be in የካቲት \(the SIXTH month\).
7. If the value of `wenber` == 0, the corresponding value of the 30th weekday for መስከረም \(the first month\) will be the value of `MEBAJA HAMER` which is technically `metkih` + weekday corresponding value or number.
8. If the value of `wenber == 0`, then Nineveh or `nenewe` will be in የካቲት \(the SIXTH month\)
